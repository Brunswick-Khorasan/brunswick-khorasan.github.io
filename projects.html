If you're seeing this and want help making a website, I have some experience and can help to look things up!
If this site does not work, then use firefox - if you are on firefox and it doesn't work, apologies

            <p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/Brunswick-Khorasan">Github</a> that this site is hosted on - it has mostly older projects (pre-2020)</p>

            <p>In 2024, I worked with Levi Heath to make a database for the problems used in one of UNL's math outreach events, Math Day. What this project does is to automate some of the more repetitive elements of generating a problem set, namely randomly selecting old problems and formatting them into a file.</p>
            <p>This project was completed in building both the database and an interface for it, and should streamline some portions of our outreach work.</p>

          <p style="padding-left: 5px;">What started as a bit of a nostalgia project has become a lot of learning about & using SQL, database management, and debugging and maneuvering through a large project. I've run this for over a year, and it has been nice having something like this to tweak. Within this project was installing and updating an abandoned module that added a player race from a future expansion.</p>

          <span style="padding-left: 5px;">
            <p>As a part of my work preparing for an asynchronous section of Math 203 (UNL's math class for non-STEM majors), I was asked to rerecord some of the lecture videos, in order to make them match with updated content. This was really cool, and has sparked interest in making more videos to teach people various topics.</p>
            <p>Later on, in order to try and replicate some of the connection of an in-person class, I made some <a href="https://brunswick-khorasan.github.io/PLVWeb/700fa23intros.html">quick videos</a> to introduce the different chapters of the course, and to provide the connective tissue that I would normally include in my lessons.</p>
